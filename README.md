## Two types of checkboxes:

Implement solutions by chosing a good modeling strategy and let the model guide the implementation.

### Part 1 - Settings (Record):

       Email Notifications
       Video Autoplay
       Use Location

Feture request - Add options to Video Autoplay

           Autoplay with auido
           Autoplay without wifi
