## Two types of checkboxes:

Implement solutions by chosing a good modeling strategy and let the model guide the implementation.

### Part 1 - Settings (Record):

       Email Notifications
       Video Autoplay
       Use Location

Feture request - Add options to Video Autoplay

           Autoplay with auido
           Autoplay without wifi

Implement the options in such a way that their checkboxes are only visible if Video Autoplay is checked. Maintain the options' states so that any that are checked and become hidded remain checked when they become visible again


### Part 2 - Fruits (Set), Animals (List), Languages (Dict):
    Fruits (Set):
        Apple
        Apricot
        Banana
        Mango
        Orage
        Plum
    Animals (List):
        Cat
        Dog
        Horse
    Languages (Dict):
        C
        elm
        haskell
        perl
        php
        python
        swift

Feature request - only 2 fruits can be selected. Maintain order. When a 3rd fruit is selected, unselect the oldest selection. Set does not handle this easily. Consider alternate data structures. Use a List for selections. This also allows changing the max to a different number.
